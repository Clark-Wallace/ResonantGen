# ResonantGen - AI Music Workstation

> **Next-gen AI-native DAW powered by natural language, modular track regeneration, and scene-based performance control.**

**Compose full multi-track songs by describing the vibe. Lock the parts you love. Regenerate the rest. Perform it live.**

---

## 🎯 Vision

ResonantGen is the first **AI-native music production engine** where natural language is the primary interface and selective regeneration enables true creative control.

### The Revolution

**Traditional DAWs + AI** = Bolted-on features  
**ResonantGen** = AI-native from the ground up

We're not adding AI to a DAW. We're building a music production system where AI **is** the interface.

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎵 **Natural Language Composition**
```
"Give me a chill lo-fi hip-hop beat at 72 BPM with jazzy chords"
→ Generates complete multi-track arrangement
```

### 🔒 **Selective Regeneration** (The Killer Feature)
```python
# Generate initial tracks
tracks = maw.generate("dark techno with driving bass")

# Lock what you love, regenerate what you don't
tracks['drums'].lock()
tracks['bass'] = maw.regenerate("more aggressive 303 acid bass")

# Perfect: Same drums, new bass that fits perfectly
```

### 🎛️ **Live Performance Mode** (Yamaha Motif-style)
- Real-time track manipulation with natural language
- Scene-based performance control
- Live regeneration during performance

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
pip install resonantgen

# Basic usage
from resonantgen import MusicWorkstation

maw = MusicWorkstation()
tracks = maw.generate("chill lo-fi hip-hop beat at 72 BPM")
tracks.play()

# Lock and regenerate
tracks['drums'].lock()
tracks['melody'] = maw.regenerate("add some vinyl crackle atmosphere")
tracks.export("my_track.wav")
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Multi-Track Generation
- **Drums**: Rhythm and percussion patterns
- **Bass**: Basslines that lock to drum patterns  
- **Harmony**: Chords, pads, atmospheric elements
- **Melody**: Lead lines, hooks, melodic content

### Context-Aware System
Each track understands and responds to:
- Locked track features (tempo, key, energy)
- Musical coherence requirements
- Frequency space allocation
- Cross-track harmonic relationships
