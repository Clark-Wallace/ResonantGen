# ResonantGen Design Documentation

## Project Vision

ResonantGen is a ground-up rebuild of AI music generation, designed specifically for natural language-driven, multi-track music production with selective regeneration capabilities. This is not just another MusicGen wrapper - it's the foundational AI engine for the next generation of music creation tools.

## What Makes ResonantGen Different

1. **Track-Aware Generation**: Generates individual tracks (drums, bass, harmony, melody) that understand each other musically
2. **Selective Regeneration**: Lock tracks you love, regenerate only what you want to change  
3. **Natural Language First**: Designed from the ground up for text-to-music workflows
4. **Modular Architecture**: Specialized models for different track types, not one model trying to do everything
5. **Performance Optimized**: Built for real-time generation on modern GPUs (RTX 3090)

## Documentation Structure

### For Implementation Team

1. **[AI_HANDOFF.md](./AI_HANDOFF.md)** - Start here! Communication guide for downstream AI instances
2. **[ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)** - High-level system design and component overview
3. **[TECHNICAL_SPEC.md](./TECHNICAL_SPEC.md)** - Detailed specifications, APIs, and performance targets
4. **[IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](./IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)** - Step-by-step guide for transforming MusicGen
5. **[MODULAR_DESIGN.md](./MODULAR_DESIGN.md)** - Module specifications and extensibility patterns

## Quick Start for Implementers

1. Read `AI_HANDOFF.md` to understand the mission
2. Review `ARCHITECTURE.md` for system overview
3. Follow `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` to begin MusicGen transformation
4. Reference `TECHNICAL_SPEC.md` for detailed requirements
5. Use `MODULAR_DESIGN.md` when building individual components

## Core Technical Decisions

- **Base**: MusicGen's EnCodec and transformer architecture
- **Models**: ~500M parameters per track type (vs MusicGen's 3.3B)
- **Framework**: PyTorch 2.0+ with CUDA 12.1
- **Audio**: 44.1kHz, 24-bit professional quality
- **Target**: 3-5 second generation for 8-second clips

## The Path Forward

### Phase 1: Prove It Works
- Extract EnCodec from MusicGen
- Build minimal drum generator  
- Generate ANY coherent audio

### Phase 2: Make It Musical
- Add remaining track types
- Implement context awareness
- Enable track locking

### Phase 3: Make It Fast
- GPU optimization
- Model quantization
- Real-time preview

### Phase 4: Make It Ship
- Full API implementation
- Frontend integration
- Performance mode

## Key Innovation: Track Locking

The killer feature that makes this revolutionary:

```python
# Generate initial tracks
tracks = generate("dark techno with driving bass")

# Lock the drums, regenerate the bass
tracks['drums'].lock()
tracks['bass'] = regenerate("make the bass more aggressive")

# Perfect drums preserved, new bass generated
```

## Success Metrics

- **Quality**: Matches or exceeds MusicGen output
- **Speed**: <10 seconds for full arrangement  
- **Coherence**: Locked tracks and new tracks work together
- **Usability**: Natural language produces expected results

## Remember

We're not building "another MusicGen" or "another AI music tool." We're building the first AI-native music production engine where natural language is the primary interface and selective regeneration enables true creative control.

Every line of code should support this vision.
